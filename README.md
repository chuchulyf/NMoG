Denoising Hyperspectral Image With Non-i.i.d. Noise Structure

The DATA folder contains two HSI data sets: Washington DC Mall and RemoteImage, which can be used in simulation experiment.

The six Demo_*.m files show different noise case in Washington DC Mall. You can just change variable 'filename' to see the performance in other dataset.

Hyperparameters and initial model parameters are robust for the performance, and generally do not need to be further tuned.
